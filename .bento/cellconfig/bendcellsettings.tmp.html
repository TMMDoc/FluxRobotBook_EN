<p><strong>Retain input GEO orientation for pickup</strong> - This retains the original part orientation when tooling on the machine. If this is disabled, the part will get flipped appropriately.</p>

<p><strong>Try jaw gripper even for slightly bigger parts</strong> - This setting tries to use the jaw gripper for parts larger than normal jaw-gripper parts, if no suitable vacuum gripper is found.</p>

<p><strong>Turn off vacuum cups to pick smaller parts</strong> - This setting tries to pick up a part using a Sub-Gripper:
this is just a vacuum gripper where the software turns off one row of suction cups automatically, making it an effectively smaller gripper.</p>
